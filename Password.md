# Login Password

## EN-XGSFPP-OMAC (XG-99S)

This stick does not have a web console.
To configure it, you must log in via `UART` or `Telnet`.

- UART Baud Rate : `115200 bps`
- Telnet IP : `192.168.100.1:23`

| User | Password |
| --- | --- |
| `PON S/N` | `8digit HMAC-MD5 (PON SN uppercase)` |

Password is generated by `/usr/bin/CigLogin` and `get_pass_by_sn` in `/usr/lib/libvos.so`.
The easiest way to generate a password is to execute the following command from the UART of the appropriate CIG ONU (GPON is also fine)

```
ONT> enable
#ONT> system/debug/md5 "your PON-S/N uppercase" 8
```

For example, if the SN is `ECIG21100005`, the user name and password would be

```
#ONT> system/debug/md5 ECIG21100005 8
MD5 Value: eWsEuWgG
```

- User : `ECIG21100005`
- Password : `eWsEuWgG`

UART does not ask for a login, it is possible to get a root shell without know the password.
