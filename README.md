# Hacking CA8271x XGS-PON Stick
Some information has been created with the help of `@stich86_0046`. Thanks!

- Rewrite S/N, Loid, PLOAM, etcâ€¦ for your ISP FTTx
- Rewrite cheap 10G-EPON Stick to XGS-PON Stick

# Login Password

## EN-XGSFPP-OMAC (XG-99S)

This stick does not have a web console.
To configure it, you must log in via `UART` or `Telnet`.

- UART Baud Rate : `115200 bps`
- Telnet IP : `192.168.100.1:23`

| User | Password |
| --- | --- |
| `PON S/N` | `8digit HMAC-MD5 (PON SN uppercase)` |

Password is generated by `/usr/bin/CigLogin` and `get_pass_by_sn` in `/usr/lib/libvos.so`.
The easiest way to generate a password is to execute the following command from the UART of the appropriate CIG ONU (GPON is also fine)

```
ONT> enable
#ONT> system/debug/md5 "your PON-S/N uppercase" 8
```

For example, if the SN is `ECIG21100005`, the user name and password would be
```
#ONT> system/debug/md5 ECIG21100005 8
MD5 Value: eWsEuWgG
```
- User : `ECIG21100005`
- Password : `eWsEuWgG`

UART does not ask for a login, it is possible to get a root shell without know the password.

## LTF-726x-BH+

This stick have SSH and web console.
but, most settings are not available on the web, plus there is a bug in the PLOAM settings.
To configure it, you must log in via `UART` or `SSH`.

- UART Baud Rate : `115200 bps`
- SSH IP : `192.168.0.1:22`

| User | Password |
| --- | --- |
| `root` | `hbmtsfp` |


## FOX222 (XG-99M)
This ONT does not have a web console.
and, telnet is also not started by default, so you need to start telnetd from UART
To configure it, you must log in via `UART`.

- UART Baud Rate : `115200 bps`
- Telnet IP : `192.168.188.1:23`

| User | Password |
| --- | --- |
| `unknown` | `8digit HMAC-MD5 (PON SN uppercase)` |

Password is generated by `/usr/bin/CigLogin` and `get_pass_by_sn` in `/usr/lib/libvos.so`.
The easiest way to generate a password is to execute the following command from the UART of the appropriate CIG ONU (GPON is also fine)

```
ONT> enable
#ONT> system/debug/md5 "your PON-S/N uppercase" 8
```

For example, if the SN is `ECIG21100005`, the user name and password would be
```
#ONT> system/debug/md5 ECIG21100005 8
MD5 Value: eWsEuWgG
```
- User : `ECIG21100005`
- Password : `eWsEuWgG`

This ont does not know the username and currently there is no way to login via telnet.
but, UART does not ask for a login, it is possible to get a root shell without know the password.


## NSD-G3000T

This ONT have a web console.
But this ont doesn't know the username of the telecom admin,
to configure it, you must log in via `UART`.

- Web IP : `192.168.188.1`
- UART Baud Rate : `115200 bps`

| User | Password |
| --- | --- |
| `unknown` | `admin_super_"your PON-MAC last 4 digit lowercase"` |

This ont does not know the telecomadmin username and currently there is no way to login via WebGui.
but, UART does not ask for a login, it is possible to get a root shell without know the password.


## HN8255Ws (So-net)

This ONT have Telnet snd web console.
Many items are configurable in the `Web`

- Web IP : `192.168.1.1`
- UART Baud Rate : `115200 bps`

| User | Password |
| --- | --- |
| `snc_admin` | `So-net_n21r15_"your PON-MAC last 4 digit uppercase"` |
