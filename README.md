# Hacking CA8271x XGS-PON Stick

Some information has been created with the help of `@stich86_0046`. Thanks!

- Rewrite S/N, Loid, PLOAM, etcâ€¦ for your ISP FTTx
- Rewrite cheap 10G-EPON Stick to XGS-PON Stick

# How to get root CLI & root Shell
## LTF-726x-BH+
Connect via `SSH` or `UART` to obtain root shell.

## EN-XGSFPP-OMAC, FOX222 (XG-99x)
After logging in via `telnet` or `UART`, you will first get the CLI with user privileges.
```
ONT>
```
The root CLI can be obtained by executing the `enable` command on this CLI.
```
ONT> enable
#ONT>
```
The root shell can be obtained by executing the following command in the root CLI.
```
#ONT> system/shell
#ONT/System/Shell> sh
#
```

There are several other commands in the root CLI.
The following is a list of typical commands,

- `/traffic/pon/show onu`<br>
Obtain ont's authentication status, SN, LOID password, PLOAM password, etc.
- `/system/misc`<br>
Change the SN, vendor, PLOAM password, and other settings stored in its custom ROM (mtd9, mtd10)<br>
- `/system/mib/show "MIB No."`<br>
Get MIB values.<br>
example,<br>
`#ONT> /system/mib/show 256`<br>
`/system/mib/show ?` command can get a list of supported MIBs.<br>
